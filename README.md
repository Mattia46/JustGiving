#Just Giving Test

## My steps:
* Installed the dependencies throught npm init
* Set up webpack instead of using react-create-app package
* Set up test environment
  * I used Enzyme with mocha, expect and fetch-mock
* Scripts: test, start (dev mode) and build (to create a min version of the project)

## How to run the project:
```
$ npm install
$ npm start
$ open public/index.html
```

## How to run the test:
```
$ npm test
```

## N.B.
** I haven't spent much time to make the app responsive
